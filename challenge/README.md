> We serve the safest steaks in the world - and the most expensive.  
> Only billionaires dine here. But we believe in opportunity.

> We host a private game hall for guests with taste, brains, and nerve.  
> Our "Steak Bounty" program is open - if you’re up for it.

> We run our infrastructure on Debian Bullseye. It’s solid. Just like our cuts.

> You start with 10 credits.  
> One steak costs 1,000,000,000.  
> Earn it in the game hall.

> For your convenience, here are the files you’ll need:

> `vuln` - the system under test  
> `vuln.c` - the source, for full transparency  
> `libc-2.31` - provided for convenience; matches the version used in Bullseye
> `names.txt` and `newspaper.txt` - used by the binary; no relevant data inside
> `localhost:1338` - the door to the game hall

> Good luck.

> Oh, and one more thing...

> The head chef lost a flag during service.  
> Not the kind we usually stick in steaks to mark doneness - this one’s more special.

> If you happen to come across it, he’d owe you one.  
> And if you’re part of the Steak Bounty program, you have permission to look around.

> No tricks.  
> No theft.  
> No bullshit.

> Just skill.
